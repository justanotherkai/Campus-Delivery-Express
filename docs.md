# Campus Delivery Express

## Program description (from guidelines):
Develop a Java program that handles user orders and deliveries (e.g, Panda Express) from within on-campus users. The program will allow the user to choose from a list of available menus from different restaurants and enter the quantity they wish to purchase. The service charge depends on the type of menu/order and the location of the restaurants (i.e., restaurants further away from campus will be charged higher cost). If the food/menu is not available, the user shall be able to change or cancel their order. The program will finally print a receipt with details of the food ordered, the total price & quantity, the location of the restaurant and the service cost charged. You may also extend your delivery services to other services such as printing/binding service, license renewal and other services needed most by campus students
